This is my take on the Rock Paper and Scissors project by The Odin Project. https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors

The asignment was to make a Rock, Paper, Scissors project that worked in the console with functions that allowed the player to easily play the game. I instead chose to add a UI into the mix for the extra challenge while maintaining the games logic.

In the future I would like to revisit this project to clean up the code and make everything look nicer and be easier to read as well as add an algorithm that is more random. The current RNG seems to favour using the same choice most of the time and I think a more balanced guess could make things quite fun for the player.
